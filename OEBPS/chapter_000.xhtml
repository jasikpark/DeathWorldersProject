<p id = "para-3">The first chapter of what would eventually become “The Deathworlders”, was posted on 4chan some years ago now, as a self-contained story.</p>
<p id = "para-4">At first I thought it had received some pleasant comments and then sank without a trace. It was only after Reddit user “Guidosbestfriend” set his own story “Humans Don’t Make Good Pets” in the same universe and I confessed to having created the setting that I learned that “The Kevin Jenkins Experience” was considered a HFY classic.</p>
<p id = "para-5">Surprising as this was, I then decided to write a sequel, and from there the clamor for more has picked me up and swept me along.</p>
<p id = "para-6">For those who are upset by the strongly antitheistic content of part 0.2, I implore you to power on through it. You may be pleasantly surprised by the resolution to that content.</p>
